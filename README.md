ðŸŽ¯ Projects
Database development on paddy cultivation in Delta region
Developed a comprehensive database on paddy cultivation in the Delta region, focusing on Ponni and IR rice varieties. Integrated detailed information from research articles, including plant growth, diseases, and characteristics, with an interactive interface for variety-specific insights.
Data analysis performing server log analysis using Linux commands
Performed server log analysis using Linux commands to detect and trace unauthorized access attempts. Identified potential hackers, distinguishing between local (Indian) and foreign IP addresses, and analysed attack patterns for cyber security insights.
AI-Driven Predicting carcinogenicity using machine learning algorithms and Descriptors using JME structure drawing in a Mobile Application
Developed an AI-driven mobile application for predicting carcinogenicity using machine learning algorithms and molecular descriptors. Utilized the TOXRIC database, removed duplicates, calculated Mordred descriptors, and built a user-friendly app where users can draw chemical structures to predict toxicity (carcinogenic or non-carcinogenic).
CASTRA-Crystallographic analysis and structural transformation tool
CASTRA is an advanced GUI tool for manipulation, visualization, and analysis of Crystallographic Information Files (CIF), offering features like bond calculations, torsion angle analysis, dimer detection, and symmetry operations. It simplifies complex crystallographic tasks with a user-friendly interface, enabling accurate and efficient structural analysis
